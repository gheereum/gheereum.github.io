# Interest of content:

	The content was very thourough, he went into lots of detail about machine learning. I liked how he did a history section 	
	and made a timeline with dates and facts. I found the content interesting aswell and enjoyed how he had included visuals
	along with the information.

	Outstanding



# Consistency and quality of visual presentation

	The whole website is very consistent, with each page having the same layout and nav bar etc. Jake's page had a very
	profession look to it, with a suitable colour theme and pictures. I liked how he has added bold and italics to some of 
	the words, I think it engages the reader more. 

	Outstanding

# Quality of written presentation

	It has been written very well, the information is very easy to follow and understand. There aren't any grammar or spelling 
	errors and a wide range of vocab has been used appropiatly. 

	Outstanding
	
# Validity of HTML

	From reading through the HTML, I can't find any errors in the code or open tags. The code is very well alligned and
	organised which makes it very easy to follow. 

	Outstanding

# Evidence of collaboration including
	
	The author bio was writen by anouther team member which is evidence of collaboration. They have said that they all	
	did a page  including the home page, and one person all did the style as well. The person who did the home page	
	didn't do any research so instead linked all the pages together and added the links for each page. They also didn't 
	leave it to last minute by setting timelines on when the actual code had to be finished. However they mention that
	they didn't push it on github till quite late. But all the code was complete and in on time for the practical. 

        Excellent
