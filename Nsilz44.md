Interest of content - Outstanding - lots of content that is really interesting.
Consistency and quality of visual presentation - Outstanding - everything looks like it was made by one person. The website looks like it was made in 2019 so very nice and clean to look at.
Quality of written presentation - - Very good - all the paragraphs were formatted well and the infomation was delivered in proper english. However there were some spelling mistakes.
Validity of HTML - Very good - code was very clear and formatted in a clear structure. However there were no comments which would make it easier to read
Evidence of collaboration - Good - the author pages were written by different people. A lot of the final commits were at 1am in the morning so a bit last minute. The contributions seemed very balanced.
