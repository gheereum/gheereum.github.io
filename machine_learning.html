                        <p><b>Machine Learning</b> is an application of <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> (AI). It is a technique of data analysis that allows systems to <i>learn and evolve on its own</i> with data and experience, with minimal human intervention. 

            

                        <p>Such systems use <i>algorithms</i> to analyse data, identify patterns, make inferences, and adapt their decision-making accordingly, as opposed to having their functions explicitly programmed by humans.</p>



                        <p>There are two main Machine Learning methods: <b>Supervised Learning</b> and <b>Unsupervised Learning</b>.</p>

                        <p>(Source: https://uk.mathworks.com/help/stats/machine-learning-in-matlab.html)</p>



                        <dl>

                            <dt>Supervised Machine Learning</dt>

                            <dd>A <i>labeled</i> set(s) of data is input to the system, which then uses it to build a model that reasonably predicts future outcomes.

                                It generates its predictions by making inferences from the data or evidence previously analysed. 

                                The system can then evaluate the accuracy of its predicitons by comparing it to the intended output (if given), for further improvements.</dd>

            

                            <dd>There are two types of predictive techniques used: <b><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-classifiers-a5cc4e1b0623" target="_blank">classification</a></b> and <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis" target="_blank">regression</a></b>, which predict discrete and continuous responses respectively.</dd>



                            <dt>Unsupervised Machine Learning</dt>

                            <dd>Contrary to Supervised Machine Learning, the data that is input to the system is <i>not labeled</i>. The system tries to identify hidden structures and patterns from the data, and make inferences from it.</dd>

                            <dd>The most common techniqued employed in this method is <b><a href="https://home.deib.polimi.it/matteucc/Clustering/tutorial_html/" target="_blank">Clustering</a></b>, which includes algorithms such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">k-means</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-medoids">k-medoids</a>, <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/gaussian-mixture-models-explained-6986aaf5a95" target="_blank"> Gaussian mixture models </a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_clustering" target="_blank">fuzzy c-means clustering.</a></dd>

                        <p>While Machine Learning has become increasingly popular in the last few years, its origins actually date back to hundreds of years ago.</p>



                        <p>The following list is a summary of the timeline of Machine Learning's history, adapted from <a href="https://www.bbc.com/timelines/zypd97h" target="_blank">BBC.</a></p>



                        <ul>

                            <li><b>Pre-1940s:</b> Machine Learning is built upon mathematical concepts that were established hundreds of years ago</li>

                                <ul>

                                    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares" target="_blank">Least Squares method</a> (1805) by Thomas Bayes and Pierre-Simon Laplace</li>

                                    <li><a href="https://www.bayestheorem.net/" target="_blank">Bayes' Theorem</a> (1812) by Adrien-Marie Legendre</li>

                            <br>

                            <li><b>1950:</b> Alan Turing wrote a <a href="https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf" target="_blank" title="Computing Machinery and Intelligence by A.M. Turing">paper</a> suggesting how artificial intelligence could be created. He also suggested a way to test a computer's intelligence, called the 'imitation game'.</li>

                            <br>

                            <li><b>1951:</b> Stochastic Neural Analog Reinforcement Computer (SNARC), the first artificial neural network was created by <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/minsky.html" target="_blank">Marvin Minsky</a> and Dean Edmonds. An artificial neural network is a computer model of how human brains work.</li>

                            <br>

                            <li><b>1960s-70s:</b> The massive interest in <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> in the 50s and 60s was followed with a lack of any significant breakthrough in the years after.  This disappointment led to an AI 'winter' of reduced research funding.</li>

                            <br>

                            <li><b>1980s:</b> New methods were being developed and old concepts were employed in more modern situations, which led to a resurgence of interest in AI. </li>

                            <br>

                            <li><b>1997:</b> After losing to world chess champion Gary Kasparov in 1996, IBM's <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/deepblue/" target="_blank">Deep Blue</a> computer managed to redeem itself and beat him a year later. This sparked massive public interest.</li>

                            <br>

                            <li><b>2006:</b> Backpropagation, a machine learning technique developed in the 1960s, was effectively reapplied to modern processors by Geoff Hinton and others. It is currently a key component in machine learning, used to train deep neural networks.   </li>

                            <br>

                            <li><b>2014:</b> <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/" target="_blank">DeepMind Technologies</a>, a British company later acquired by Google, became famous for developing a neural network that could play video games through studying the movement of pixels.</li>

                            <br>

                            <li><b>2016:</b> <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far" target="_blank">AlphaGo</a>, a neural network developed by DeepMind researchers, managed to defeat the second-best and best Go players in the world in 2016 and 2017 respectively. This shocked AI researchers as they were not expecting computers to beat humans in such a difficult game so soon. </li>

                        In addition to chess and Go, Machine Learning is utilised across many sectors in today's society. Here are some of its modern applications:

                        

                        <ul>

                            <br>

                            <li><b>Language:</b> OpenAI developed a <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/" target="_blank">model</a> that can generate coherent text, comprehend text, answer questions and summarise.</li>

                            <br>

                            <li><b>Healthcare:</b> Machine Learning is being used to identify trends and <a href="https://healthcare.ai/applications-of-healthcare-machine-learning/" target="_blank">predict potential health complications</a> in patients by analysing their health vitals and history. 

                                It is also used to perform highly accurate medical diagnoses, greatly reducing human error and time consumption. Such diagnoses include <a href="https://www.intogral.com/macular.html#solution" target="_blank">analysing macular holes in eyes </a> and <a href="https://www.visionuk.org.uk/researchers-use-artificial-intelligence-to-improve-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-birdshot-uveitis/" target="_blank">birdshot uveitis.</a></li>

                            <br>

                            <li><b>Finance:</b> Financial institutions use machine learning for <a href="https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/machine-learning.html#machine-learning-users">fraud prevention and obtaining insights from their data.</a> 

                                This analysis data to solve business (or other) problems is also known as <a href="https://www.oracle.com/big-data/guide/what-is-big-data.html">Big Data</a>>.

                            Machine Learning can also be used to <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/4500278692/Atom-Bank-to-offer-artificial-intelligence-based-customer-support" target="_blank">enchance customer support.</a></li>
