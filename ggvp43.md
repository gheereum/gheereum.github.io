Interest of Content (Excellent)
Really interesting content, you can tell a lot of specific research has been conducted on each of the subsections. Also each topic is unique which adds to the quality of the site as a whole. Perhaps add in some fun facts in each section and reduce the explaination of social media as many people are already aware of what it is.
Consistency and Quality of Visual Presentation (Examplary)
Consistant styling throughout the site, great use of links at the top of subsections taking you to specific elements of the page. Also good use of formatted images especially inclusing consistancy by adding the source of each image to all present across the site.Perhaps use the same subsections in each page just to add to the consistency.
Quality of Written Presentation (Outstanding)
Almost perfect grammer, spelling and punctuation. Also content was presented clearly with appropriate links to outside webpages when more information may be needed for understanding. Perhaps in the 'History' section of the social media page the information could be presented more clearly.
Validity of HTML(Excellent)
All links worked and all of the formatting and HTML was valid. The only approvement would be to use the <q> tag when using quotation marks on the antivirus page.
Evidence of Collaboration(Acceptable)
Author bios are evident, but github shows no evidence of collaboration from other members. Also all commits seem to have been made very early in the morning of the assignment, so perhaps next time more time management within the group and remember to make meaningful documentations of your input through github.
