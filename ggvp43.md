Interest of Content (Excellent)
Really interesting content, you can tell a lot of specific research has been conducted on each of the subsections. Also each topic is unique which adds to the quality of the site as a whole. Perhaps add in some fun facts in each section and reduce the explaination of social media as many people are already aware of what it is.
Consistency and Quality of Visual Presentation
Consistant styling throughout the site, great use of links at the top of subsections taking you to specific elements of the page. Also good use of formatted images especially inclusing consistancy by adding the source of each image to all present across the site.Perhaps use the same subsections in each page just to add to the consistency.
Quality of Written Presentation
